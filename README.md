# ZMK Mouse Gesture Module

A ZMK module that converts sequences of 8-way mouse strokes into key presses or any other behaviors.

> [!warning]
> ðŸš§ This module is still under development. ðŸš§

> The current implementation has a bug that causes the keyboard to crash.

> Its behavior or API may change without notice.

## Installation

Add the Module to your `west.yml`.

```yml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: kot149
      url-base: https://github.com/kot149
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: zmk-mouse-gesture
      remote: kot149
      revision: v1
  self:
    path: config
```

## Usage

### 1. Include `mouse-gesture.dtsi`

```c
#include <mouse-gesture.dtsi>
```

### 2. Add activation key

```dts
/ {
    keymap {
        compatible = "zmk,keymap";

        default_layer {
            bindings = <
                // Activates mouse gesture while it is pressed
                &mouse_gesture
            >;
        };
    };
};
```

### 3. Configure Input Listener

Define the gesture patterns in `&zip_mouse_gesture`and add it to the input processor of your pointing device.

```dts
#include <mouse-gesture.dtsi>

&zip_mouse_gesture {
    stroke-size = <1000>; // Size of one stroke in a gesture

    // Simple gesture for history back (Alt+Left)
    history_back {
        gesture = <GESTURE_RIGHT>;
        bindings = <&kp LA(LEFT)>;
    };

    // Simple gesture for history forward (Alt+Right)
    history_forward {
        gesture = <GESTURE_LEFT>;
        bindings = <&kp LA(RIGHT)>;
    };

    // Down then right gesture for close tab (Ctrl+W)
    close_tab {
        gesture = <GESTURE_DOWN GESTURE_RIGHT>;
        bindings = <&kp LC(W)>;
    };

    // Down then left gesture for new tab (Ctrl+T)
    new_tab {
        gesture = <GESTURE_DOWN GESTURE_LEFT>;
        bindings = <&kp LC(T)>;
    };

    // Clockwise triangle gesture for volume up
    volume_up {
        gesture = <GESTURE_DOWN_RIGHT GESTURE_LEFT GESTURE_UP_RIGHT>;
        bindings = <&kp C_VOLUME_UP>;
    };

    // Anti-clockwise triangle gesture for volume down
    volume_down {
        gesture = <GESTURE_DOWN_LEFT GESTURE_RIGHT GESTURE_UP_LEFT>;
        bindings = <&kp C_VOLUME_DOWN>;
    };
};

&trackball_listener {
    compatible = "zmk,input-listener";
    device = <&trackball>;

    input-processors = <&zip_mouse_gesture>;
};
```

#### Available Gesture Directions

- `GESTURE_UP` - Upward movement
- `GESTURE_DOWN` - Downward movement
- `GESTURE_LEFT` - Leftward movement
- `GESTURE_RIGHT` - Rightward movement
- `GESTURE_UP_LEFT` - Diagonal up-left movement
- `GESTURE_UP_RIGHT` - Diagonal up-right movement
- `GESTURE_DOWN_LEFT` - Diagonal down-left movement
- `GESTURE_DOWN_RIGHT` - Diagonal down-right movement

### 5. Perform the gesture

Hold the activation key and perform the gesture.

## How it works

While `&mouse_gesture` is pressed, `&zip_mouse_gesture` listens to mouse input events and accumulates the movement value.
When accumulated value become bigger than `stroke-size`, the processor judges its direction, then pushes it to mouse gesture sequence.
When matching gesture found for the sequence, its bindings will be invoked.
The accumulated value is reset when the direction is detected.
The sequence is cleared when a gesture is detected or activation key is released.
